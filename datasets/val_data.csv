"Islamic philosophy has dealt at length with the study of inherent mental qualities and inclinations among human beings with special reference to moral virtue . Some human beings are totally inclined to the pursuit of virtue , and are consumed with desire for knowledge of the Divine World , known as m ' arifat , or gnosis . Others tend to be carried away by the things and pleasures of the world . There is a middle , order of persons who have inclination to gnosis , and also have aptitude for worldly , affairs . This last category is described by Imam Razi , writing in the 12th century , as "" the people of the right hand or the balanced people "" , and to such persons , control over the affairs of their fellowmen rightly belongs . The task is never easy ; mere goodness is no guarantee for success . Possession of all the virtues alone is not sufficient . There must be inspiration from a higher source . The element of marifat provides the necessary directions , by holding the attention to the Divine light .
